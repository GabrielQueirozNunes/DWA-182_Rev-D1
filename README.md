# Driver for rtl88x2bu wifi adaptors with focus on DWA-182

Updated driver for rtl88x2bu wifi adaptors based on
[cilynx/rtl88x2bu](https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2bu). The project started
with official versions downloaded from [D-Link's download page for the DWA-182
Rev D](https://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DWA-182). Unfortunately,
D-Link's version stopped do work on Linux v5.3.


## Purpose of the repository

The purpose of this repository is to update the driver such that it can be
compiled with recent versions of the Linux kernel on x86-64. The repository
of [cylinx](https://github.com/cilynx/rtl88x2bu) does something very similar.

The main difference between this and cilynx' repositories are that this
repository compiles with `-O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror` (and can compile with `-O3
â€¦`), leading to few additional bugfixes and possibly some performance
improvements. On the other hand, cylinx' repository seems to support some
RasperryPi use cases and some more devices.

## Simple Usage

In order to make direct use of the driver it should suffice to build the driver
with `make` and to load it with `insmod 88x2bu.ko`. This will allow you
to use the driver directly without changing your system persistently.

## DKMS installation

If you want to have the driver available at startup, it will you convenient to
register it in DKMS. This can be done completely automatically with the script
`deploy.sh`.
